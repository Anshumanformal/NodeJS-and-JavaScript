/*
NodeJS implicitely converts the code into a Module wrapper function.

() - This is termed as grouping operator. Module wrapper 
     anonymous function is written inside it.

Syntax:

function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname){
    //code
}();

The last parenthesis is used to run code. If it's not added the code won't run.

Note:
1. All code written inside the grouping operator is private by default.
2. Any piece of code written outside the grouping operator throws error.
