//When we use function currying, we don't have to pass all the arguments at once.
// Instead, the parent function takes an argument and returns a new function, which takes the second argument and returns a new function
 and so on until all arguments are completed.
 
 Advantages:-
 1. It can be used to check whether all the arguments are received or not.
 2. It can help to avoid passing the same variables again and again.
 
 // Non-curried function
 
 const addFunc = (a,b,c) => {
  return a + b + c;
 }
 
 console.log(addFunc(1,2,3));
 // Curried function
 
 const addFunc = (a) => {
    return (b) => {
        return (c) => {
          return a + b + c;
        }
    }
 }
 
 console.log(addFunc(1)(2)(3));
