HTTP header fields:

1. method
2. path
3. protocol
4. HTTP headers as Name : Value pairs

HTTP is stateless so we need to send some kind of token(like JWT) within the Authorization header, in order to access a protected page or route, unless we are
using sessions on a server.

HTTP status codes:

1xx : Informational
Request received / processing

2xx : Success
Successfully received, understood and accepted

3xx : Redirect
Further action must be taken / redirect

4xx : Client Error
Request does not have what it needs. Eg: lastName field is required, but the request didn't send it.

5xx : Server Error
Server failed to fulfil an apparent valid request

Multiplexing(in HTTP/2):
Here, after get request for index.html(i.e. the main page) is done, get request to styles.css and scripts.js is done at one go. They
are received together at one shot too. This demonstrates multiplexing.


One major difference between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 is that:

After any get, post or any method done in HTTP/1.1   --> connection gets closed.
After any get, post or any method done in HTTP/2   --> connection remains open.
