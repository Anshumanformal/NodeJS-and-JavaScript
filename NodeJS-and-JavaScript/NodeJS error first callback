DEFINING AN ERROR-FIRST CALLBACK:

Thereâ€™s really only two rules for defining an error-first callback:

1. The first argument of the callback is reserved for an error object. If an error occurred, it will be returned by the first err argument.
2. The second argument of the callback is reserved for any successful response data. If no error occurred, err will be set to null and any
successful data will be returned in the second argument.

Continuation Passing Style(CPS) is the old-school name for how Node.js uses callbacks today.
