The JavaScript code goes through the Parser inside the JavaScript Engine.

Note: Chrome's JavaScript Engine is called - V8 JavaScript engine(also used in NodeJS).
      Mozilla's JavaScript Engine is called - Spidermonkey
      
The parser converts the code into AST(Abstract Syntax Tree) which is a tree like structure which denotes
how the code is going to be executed.

The AST converts the code into Machine code.
Then this machine code is executed to produce output.
