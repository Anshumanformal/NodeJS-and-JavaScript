Difference between the usage of 'for/in' and 'for/of'.

Both for..in and for..of are looping constructs which
are used to iterate over data structures. The only
difference between them is the entities they iterate
over: for..in iterates over all enumerable property keys
of an object. for..of iterates over the values of an iterable object.

for in --> can be used to count the number of keys in an object.
           Another way is also to use the method Object.keys(<objectname>).

for of --> can be used to count the number of values in an object.
